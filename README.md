# TV-Script-Generation
# Overview 
As part of the [Deep Learning NanoDegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101), TV Script Generation uses the Seinfeld dataset to generate a fake Seinfeld TV script. 
It generates Seinfeld TV scripts using a Recurrent Neural Network. 
The project is based on the [TV Script Generation repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation).
